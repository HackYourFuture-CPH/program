# Final Project

This repository contains information about the final module of the program, where you will take everything you have learned so far and work together as a team to build a final project together.

This module usually runs for 4-5 weeks.

The final project is organised differently for each team, depending on the team responsible, mentors and the opportunities available at the time. The options could include:

1. Mentor-designed projects and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
2. Trainee-proposed projects (e.g. [example project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11my-sb4T3UziIhjJlYOi60Afxq2dUncE8WYZ8yA-HCY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ik8don4y6sav)) and built using [HYF Project Template](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/hyf-project-template)
3. Client-driven projects designed in collaboration with a real client partner, built using their own template.

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Collaboration in a team setting
  - [ ] Learn to read and extend or improve other peoples code
  - [ ] Learn to give/receive PR feedback
  - [ ] Learn to plan and communicate technical solutions upfront before implementing
- [ ] Develop self-guided learning skills (e.g. learn to read documetation for a framework or API)
- [ ] Interpreting wireframes/prototypes into requirements
- [ ] Breaking bigger problems into smaller written tasks
- [ ] Working in sprints with deadlines
- [ ] Asking for help effectively and at the right time (e.g. describing problems to mentors, asking online, and the power _and_ limitations of ChatGPT)
- [ ] Deploying a completed project you are proud to showcase on your portfolio

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization

- Team code generation and validation
- Basic access control _- Permissions to restrict user access depending on who they are_
- Session management _- Maintain user state during their use of the app_

### Data Validation

- Input sanitization _- Ensure all user input is cleaned to prevent security vulnerabilities_
- Form validation _- Validate user inputs to make sure they fit any specific criteria you have (e.g. strong passwords)_
- Error handling _- Provide feedback on inputs if something isn't right_

### API Development

- RESTful endpoints _- Implement endpoints that adhere to REST principles_
- Request/response handling _- Handle both making requests and handling their responses sufficiently_
- Error responses _- Handle errors from the API (e.g. informing the client, updating the UI appropriately)_

### Database Operations

- CRUD operations _- Create, Read, Update and Delete functions to manage your data_
- Relationship handling _- Define and manage appropriate relationships between your data objects_
- Data integrity _- Ensure accuracy and consistency of your data (e.g. constraints, validation)_

### UI/UX Requirements

- Responsive design _- A layout that adapts to different screen sizes_
- Form handling _- User friendly user input and submission flows_
- Loading states _- Visual indicators when content is not fully loaded_
- Error states _- User friendly, actionable feedback when something goes wrong_
- Success feedback _- Positive feedback when things are going to plan_

## Examples of previous final projects

### Team 27 (Aarhus)

They had the opportunity to work with two real clients. So the team was split into two 7 person teams, and worked together on these proposals:

1. Atomic Learning Systems - [Intro](<https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Atomic%20Learning%20Systems%20Company%20Document.pdf>), [Proposal](<https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Final%20project%20guide%20Atomic%20Learning.pdf>), [Live demo](https://atomic-learning-systems-hackyourfuture.onrender.com/), [Final code](https://github.com/Atomic-learning-systems/HackYourFuture)
2. Kazboo - [Intro](<https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Kazboo%20Company%20Document.pdf>), [Proposal](<https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2027%20(Aarhus)/Final%20project%20guide%20Kazboo.pdf>), [Live demo](https://class27-kazboo.onrender.com/), [Final code](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/class27-kazboo)

### Team 26 (Copenhagen)

They had three teams & projects to choose from, all within the theme of "Team Health" ([Intro](<https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/finalproject/blob/readme/Example%20projects/Team%2026%20(Copenhagen)/HyF%20final%20project%2C%20team%2026.pdf>))
