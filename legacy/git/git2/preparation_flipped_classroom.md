# Preparation for flipped classroom

Before the Git 2 class on Sunday, it is very important that the students watch the following videos:

- [git branches part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sZ7RLDESew) by Nathan Kuik (ignore the exercise he mentions :) );
- [git branches part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vgGeH3Dmwk) by Nathan Kuik;
- [git reset, revert, and cherry-pick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf3vJYnxNu0), or in short: how to get rid of commits when you mess up, by Ida Naderian;
- [git stash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlgrs8MA0Jg);
- [how to solve merge conflicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlHQpRCEMwg).
