# Templates

We'd like the program to stay consistent in the way we create, structure and style content. So in this directory you can find templates of what various parts of the program should look like.

If you are creating content that a template exists for (e.g. a new [module](./module/)), you should follow the template as closely as possible. This will be a requirement for your PR to get approved and merged.

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome! If you have an idea to improve a template, feel free to make a pull request to discuss.
