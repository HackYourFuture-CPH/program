# Preparation

## Reading List

> [!TIP]
> If you have some great external resources, you might want to create an external reading list for trainees to go through before the session.

Read/watch through this list of content before you come to the session:

- [`Title`](https://example.com/) by `Author`

## `Topic`

> [!TIP]
> Additionally, or instead of, you may wish to write your own pre-reading content. Be sure to keep it clear, consice, related to the learning goals - and think about using images and diagrams to make it easier to digest.
