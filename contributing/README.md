# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to fork the repo and suggest changes. 

If you would like to take a more active role in contributing to this repo as a volunteer at HYF Denmark, join #curriculum-crew to get involved.
Write in there to introduce yourself, and a staff member will onboard you and set you up with permissions.

## How to contribute
(We will flesh these processes more as we go...)

### Existing issues
Very briefly: check the issues, ideally one near the top, assign it, clone the repo, do it, make a PR, profit.
Contribute new ideas and suggestions by opening an issue.

### New ideas
Very briefly: Add an issue to this repo, get some feedback, and we'll prioritise them together at the next meeting.

Note: You are always welcome to open issues/create PRs for new ideas, whenever you like. It's an open source project. If we are currently working together towards a project goal, then it would be most helpful to prioritise tasks for that first, though.

## How permissions work
Permissions are managed through GitHub teams, their roles on this repo, and branch rules.
- _HYF Staff_ members have the admin role (to do things like changing repo settings, inviting new contributors).
- Members of the _Curriculum Crew_ team on GitHub have the write role (to do things like cloning, pushing branches, approving PRs - any volunteer is welcome here!).
- Two approvals by anyone in _Curriculum Crew_ or _HYF Staff_ are required on a PR before merging is allowed.
- Merging to Main can be performed by any _HYF Staff_ member.
