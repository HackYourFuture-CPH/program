# 2025 27th April

**Attendees:** Adam, Saloumeh, Bj√∏rn, Hossein, Marco, Natalia, Rachel, Jason

## Agenda
1. Thanks
1. Reflect on last two weeks (what worked, what didn't)
3. Run through current tasks
4. Plan next tasks

### 1. Thanks
Mega thanks to Rachel for setting _so_ much good stuff in the new repo, linting, link checking, and moving ALL of our legacy modules over into the monorepo.
Also mega thanks to Natlia for putting together the proposal for splitting js/node - the biggest remaining puzzle piece in the curriculum.

### 2. Reflection
#### Things that didn't work so well:
- Review requires on PRs to 1? Yes.
- Bit unclear where to have discussions (some slack, pr, issue). Finding it is hard. Keep slack discussions linked/sumarised into PRs.
- Tasks were quite broad at this point, difficult to estimate, hard to take a task because of this
- Some felt like they couldn't contribute much recently. **Important note:** Being engaged, following conversations, replying with feedback, is all really helpful too and super appreciated, even if you're week is too busy to take a task on your own.

#### Things working good:
- Monorepo is going well! consistency across content, finding everything in one place.
- Biweekly/weekly catch up sessions work well, both online and offline makes a nice balance. Summary of notes afterwards, with clear goals/next steps for the next "two weeks" is good.
- Github kanban board for managing issues, priority, visibility etc. is nice

#### Actions:
1. Switch to one required reviewer
2. Keep meeting agendas/notes in github, link to them from other places (invites, slack reminders).
3. Continue to consider how to best keep conversations in the right/organised places, it feels disjointed right now.

### 3/4. Current tasks and next steps

#### [Plan for splitting up js/node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/programme/issues/4)
1. Keep it open for a week longer for more feedback
1. Saloumeh is trying to get some other mentors to help review (sorry, forgot the names!)
2. Adam to ping again in slack to remind more to review it
3. Start splitting tasks up already...

Next steps:
Our plan should be to start getting content into the courses, small PRs, and easily to iterate later.
So, create course outlines in the readmes, link to legacy content, make notes of new stuff to be added as stubs, etc.
Create tickets for additional changes (e.g. final projects, or smaller stuff like "change exercises in module x)
Note: Legacy modules should not be modified. Linking is fine for now, but we need to copy them over at some point, and if/when we want to edit the content, it's a good time to do that!

Next goals for next time?
Adam to summarise these:
1. Suggestion: Foundatioan learning goal outline (e.g. the raedme with links to stuff)
2. Also: JS learning goal outlined in specialisms too

## Next steps
