# 2025 27th April

**Attendees:** Adam, Saloumeh, Bj√∏rn, Hossein, Marco, Natalia, Rachel, Jason

## Agenda

1. Thanks
1. Reflect on last two weeks (what worked, what didn't)
1. Run through current tasks
1. Plan next tasks

### 1. Thanks

Mega thanks to Rachel for setting _so_ much good stuff in the new repo, linting, link checking, and moving ALL of our legacy modules over into the monorepo.
Also mega thanks to Natalia for putting together the proposal for splitting js/node - the biggest remaining puzzle piece in the curriculum.

### 2. Reflection

#### Things that didn't work so well

- Review requires on PRs to 1? Yes.
- Bit unclear where to have discussions (some slack, pr, issue). Finding it is hard. Keep slack discussions linked/summarised into PRs.
- Tasks were quite broad at this point, difficult to estimate, hard to take a task because of this
- Some felt like they couldn't contribute much recently. **Important note:** Being engaged, following conversations, replying with feedback, is all really helpful too and super appreciated, even if you're week is too busy to take a task on your own.

#### Things working good

- Monorepo is going well! consistency across content, finding everything in one place.
- Biweekly/weekly catch up sessions work well, both online and offline makes a nice balance. Summary of notes afterwards, with clear goals/next steps for the next "two weeks" is good.
- Github kanban board for managing issues, priority, visibility etc. is nice

#### Other things to note

- Feel free to work on this project at HYF on Sundays, if you'd like to meet up. If you want a meeting room at any point, get in touch with Saloumeh a couple of days in advance.

#### Actions

1. Switch to one required reviewer (update contributing readme, share in slack. note that more reviewers should often be requested when necessary (give examples) it's just not enforced in github). Reminder that all staff can merge stuff, if it's fully approved, ping anyone if something is blocked.
2. Keep meeting agendas/notes in github, link to them from other places (invites, slack reminders).
3. Continue to consider how to best keep conversations in the right/organised places, it feels disjointed right now.

### 3/4. Current tasks and next steps

#### [Plan for splitting up js/node](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/programme/issues/4)

1. Keep it open for a week longer for more feedback
1. Saloumeh is trying to get some other mentors to help review (sorry, forgot the names!)
1. Adam to ping again in slack to remind more to review it
1. Start splitting tasks up already...

**Next steps:**

- Our plan should be to start getting content into the courses, small PRs, and easily to iterate later.
- So, create course outlines in the readmes, link to legacy content, make notes of new stuff to be added as stubs, etc.
- Create tickets for additional changes (e.g. final projects, or smaller stuff like "change exercises in module x)
- **Note: Legacy modules should not be modified.** Linking is fine for now, but we need to copy them over at some point, and if/when we want to modify the content, it's a good time to do that!

## Goals for next time (2 weeks)

1. Foundation learning goal outline (according to the "next steps" just above)
2. Implement JS split plan according to proposal, and any remaining "large" tasks written up on the board.

## Next steps

(I will only include next steps here that are about the organisation of the project, not specific tasks themselves, which should be covered in their corresponding issue).

- [ ] Adam: Move [Existing Curriculum Restructure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/151MLm-8WA6jSk0-9JhBTuG1xZ9Fo9HRLplJx6Bhps6A/edit?tab=t.0) into github somehow (according to "next steps" just above) to simplify the source of truth to just this repo.
- [ ] Adam: Write some tasks to help start the JS split plan while waiting for remaining feedback on the proposal
