# Using Generative AI at HackYourFuture

Whether you're applying to join HackYourFuture or are already enrolled in the program, you may consider using Generative AI tools to solve various problems. This includes tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and similar. This guideline outlines how HackYourFuture views the use of AI and our expectations for how you should (and should not) use it while working with us.

> [!WARNING]
> It’s important that you follow these guidelines. If we find evidence that you’ve misused AI as outlined below, you may be rejected from the application process or removed from the program.

## How you can use AI

Used effectively, AI can be a great tool to support your learning journey and skill development. However, if you're not careful, it can hinder your progress and take away important learning opportunities.

We discourage using AI to generate complete coding solutions and assignments, especially in the early stages of learning, where building a fundamental understanding of the core concepts is crucial. Instead of simply copying and pasting generated code, we encourage you to use AI to explore explanations, check your thinking, and deepen your understanding.

### Good use cases

1. Looking up unfamilar technical words, concepts or error messages

   e.g. "I'm learning about web development, what could the term 'client' mean in the context of a web app?"

1. Learning about alternative solutions/options that you haven’t come across yet

   e.g. "I'm printing an error using 'console.log', are there alternatives I could use?"

1. Getting feedback on your communication, messages and documentation

   e.g. "I'm writing a message to my teammate to ask for a favour, is there a more thoughtful way to phrase my last sentence?"

### Poor use cases (these are not allowed)

1. Generating full coding solutions, functions or using AI-assisted auto-complete:

   e.g. "I need to build a todo app for my assignment, please generate the JavaScript code for this"

1. Generating code comments or explanations of the solutions you create (they should be written by you, based on your own understanding)

   e.g. "Add code comments to my code to explain what every function does"

1. Generating your written communication for you (e.g. application form, cover letters, slack messages)

   e.g. "I'm applying to HackYourFuture, please write a cover letter for me that I can send with my application"

1. During the interview to help you answer questions (unless the interviewer asks you to use AI)

   e.g. Secretly typing the questions we ask you into ChatGPT, and sharing those answers with us as your own

## How your experience and knowledge will be evaluated

While you're welcome to use AI tools (following the guidelines above), please be aware that **you must be able to clearly explain all your answers and code** during your time at HackYourFuture. Whenever you create, submit, or share code or solutions, make sure you fully understand how they work based on your own knowledge.

For example, if you use AI to help you learn about a specific CSS feature that you end up using, it's important you understand what it is and why you chose to use it. You could also be asked this during the application process, or as part of submitting your assignments.

## HackYourFuture’s stance on AI

HackYourFuture's Program is not just a course to pass to gain a certificate. It's above all a learning opportunity, with a big focus on building your foundational knowledge and skills to land a job in tech. While AI can definitely support that goal, it's important for us to set guidelines to ensure the most effective learning experience possible, in the short amount of time you learn with us.

We also take into account that while the world is exploding with the introduction of AI, and changing rapidly every day, the impact of AI in the long term on our day-to-day work and lives is still unclear.

For now, we know AI is a useful tool with a vast variety of applications. It has also made its way into many of our internal workflows at HYF. Therefore, to maintain realism and fairness, we aim to support a reasonable and effective usage of AI. During your time at HYF, you will also have the opportunity to learn more about AI, how to get the best of it, and its place in the workplace.

It is, however, important for us to continue to evaluate your personal level of experience, knowledge, skills and progress - because that's what we're here to help you with! That’s why we require you to be able to communicate and explain all of your answers and code in detail (e.g. in the interviews, submitting assignments etc.) without the help of AI.
