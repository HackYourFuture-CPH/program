# Session Plan

## Main topics

- Advanced principles Agile, Scrum, Kanban and their differences
- Day-to-day useage of Scrum as a developer in a team
- How to be part of standup, planning, estimating/prioriting, retrospectives
- Breaking down user stories into well structured technical tasks
- Participating in common workflows for reviewing, testing and deploying tasks
- How these practices tie back to increasing agility
- Introduction to using more advanced tools for managing projects, such as Jira.

Note: This module is, currently, taught in developer specialism courses. That means we should focus on teaching this from the perspective of a junior frontend/backend as much as possible. For example, they might not lead a retrospective in their first job, but they should very much understand the value, purpose and how to contribute well to one.
