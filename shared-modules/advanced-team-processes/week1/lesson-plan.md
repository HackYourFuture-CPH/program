# Lesson Plan

## Main topics

- Advanced principles Agile, Scrum, Kanban and their differences
- Project work in a team (MVP, understanding of the project)
- Breaking down user stories into well structured technical tasks
- Participants in scrum events (Daily StandUps and Planning)
- Differences between Scrum and Kanban
- Retrospectives
- Introduction to using more advanced tools for managing projects, such as Jira.

Note: This module is, currently, taught in developer specialism courses. That means we should focus on teaching this from the perspective of a junior frontend/backend as much as possible. For example, they might not lead a retrospective in their first job, but they should very much understand the value, purpose and how to contribute well to one.

> Note: This course should bring more practise work and show real examples

## 🧩 Part 1: Advanced principles of Agile, Scrum, Kanban and their differences

- Grasp the high-level Agile values and principles
- Scrum principles
- Scrum roles
- Scrum events
- Scrum artefacts

## 📖 Content

### 🔶 What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a **sequential software development model**: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance

✅ Pros:
• Predictable
• Good for fixed requirements

❌ Cons:
• Late feedback
• High cost of change
• Misalignment risk

### 🔶 Why Agile emerged?

Agile was created in response to Waterfall's rigidity. The **Agile Manifesto (2001)** values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### 🔸 Agile vs. Waterfall

|                      |               |             |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **Aspect**           | **Waterfall** | **Agile**   |
| Structure            | Sequential    | Iterative   |
| Change Handling      | Rigid         | Flexible    |
| Customer Involvement | Limited       | Continuous  |
| Testing              | At the end    | Ongoing     |
| Delivery             | Big-bang      | Incremental |

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Agile is not a methodology — it's a **mindset** focused on value, learning, and adaptability.

### 🔸 Scrum principles

- Empiricism — Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
- Self-management — Teams decide how to work
- Cross-functionality — Team has all skills needed
- Iterative Progress — Frequent increments to inspect and adapt

### 🔸 Scrum Roles

|               |                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role**      | **Responsibilities**                                |
| Product Owner | Maximizes value, owns the Product Backlog           |
| Scrum Master  | Coaches, facilitates, removes impediments           |
| Developers    | Cross-functional professionals building the product |

### 🔸 Scrum Events

|                      |                                                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event**            | **Purpose**                                          |
| Sprint               | Time-boxed iteration (max 1 month)                   |
| Sprint Planning      | Define Sprint Goal, select work, plan delivery       |
| Daily Scrum          | 15-min sync for progress and re-planning             |
| Sprint Review        | Present Increment, gather feedback                   |
| Sprint Retrospective | Reflect and improve team collaboration and processes |

### 🔸 Scrum Artifacts

|                 |                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Artifact**    | **Description**                                          |
| Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything needed in the product         |
| Sprint Backlog  | Selected work for Sprint + delivery plan                 |
| Increment       | Working product output that meets the Definition of Done |

📌 **Definition of Done (DoD):** Shared understanding of “complete”, enforced by Developers, ensures transparency and consistency.

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Scrum gives structure to Agile — it’s simple, but powerful when practiced with discipline and empathy.
