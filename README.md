# The HackYourFuture Denmark Program

When you sign up for HackYourFuture (HYF) Denmark, you have the opportunity to join our 8 month program. It is split into two parts: a foundation course and a specialism course. In Foundation, you get a chance to practice the fundamentals of web development before you get the chance to specialise down a specific path to suit your skills and interests in the world of tech.

This repository contains all of our courses, modules, guides and other learning resources that we use throughout our learning program.

## What does the program look like?

We provide an environment for self-directed learning of the fundamentals of web development. We are not a school, we are a learning community, supported by a network of skilled mentors from the tech industry. HackYourFuture requires 30 hours of independent study per week, of which 4 hours are on-site sessions on Sundays. You are responsible for your own learning, delivering your assignments on time and showing up to the sessions well prepared. Together, we will discover state-of-the-art tools and frameworks, industry best-practices, and experience working collaboratively in a modern development team.
