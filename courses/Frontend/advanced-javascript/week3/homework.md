# Homework

## So why this homework?

Promises creates a **pleasant way of working with asynchronous code**. It will make your asynchronous code nearly look synchronous. It is possible to compose promises further developing the function part of javascript.

Since promises is becoming standard in javascript, new browser api's use promises for interacting with them. `getUserMedia` for accessing webcam, `Navigator.getBattery()` for getting battery level, `Bluetooth.requestDevice()`, `serviceWorker` or `USB.requestDevice()`
