# Session Plan

## Part 0: Review AI HYF AI Guidelines (5 mins)

- Quickly run through the [HYF AI Guideline](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/programme/blob/main/guidelines/ai-usage.md) and see if anyone has any questions to clarify.

## Part 1: Foundations of Generative AI (45 mins)

- Icebreaker: "Where have you already seen AI being used?"
- **Mini-lecture + short video**: What is Generative AI? (LLMs, what they can/can’t do)
- Activity: Students sketch a quick analogy (“LLM is like…”) to explain AI simply.
- Discussion: Benefits vs. limitations in workplace and learning.

## Part 2: AI Literacy in Practice (45 mins)

- Risks & Ethics: Bias, misinformation, copyright, hallucinations, privacy.
- Case study: Short scenarios where AI could be helpful or harmful.
- Group activity: Sort examples into *appropriate- vs.*inappropriate- uses.
- Reflection: “How might AI change the skills needed in your future jobs?”

## Break (10 mins)

## Part 3: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot (60 mins)

- Demo: Setting up Copilot in VS Code. [Setup Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)
- Short practice: Write a simple HTML page with Copilot’s help. [Quick Start Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started?originUrl=%2Fdocs%2Fcopilot%2Fgetting-started)
- Guided exercise: Add CSS styling + JavaScript interactivity with Copilot suggestions.
- Pair activity: Compare Copilot’s output with documentation/tutorial approaches.

### Prompts

- Create a simple HTML page with a heading, a paragraph, and a list of 3 items.
- Add CSS to style the page: center the heading, change the paragraph text color, and make the list items bold.
- Add JavaScript that shows an alert when the page loads.

## Part 4: Prompting Techniques & Critical Evaluation (50 mins)

- Intro to prompting basics (clear instructions, examples, constraints). [Official Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/prompt-crafting?originUrl=%2Fdocs%2Fcopilot%2Fsetup)
- Hands-on: Students craft prompts for Copilot to solve a small task (e.g., responsive nav bar).
- Peer review: Swap prompts & outputs—critique accuracy, style, and efficiency.
- Mini-discussion: “When should you trust Copilot, and when should you double-check?”

### Prompt

- Create a responsive navigation bar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The nav bar should collapse into a hamburger menu on small screens.

## Part 5: Reflection & Wrap-Up (30 mins)

- Group sharing: What worked well with Copilot? What was frustrating?
- Reflective writing: “How will I use AI responsibly to support my learning?”
- Quick Q\&A: Connect AI literacy to long-term skill growth.
- Recap of key takeaways + prep for next session.
