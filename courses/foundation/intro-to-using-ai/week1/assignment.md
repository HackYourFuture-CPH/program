## Build & reflect on a personal “About Me” page

### Task overview

You will create a simple, styled “About Me” webpage using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with the support of **GitHub Copilot**. Along the way, you’ll practice writing prompts, evaluating Copilot’s outputs, and reflecting on responsible use of AI in learning.

For each step, remember to follow:

1. [The Prompting Template](./session-plan.md#prompting-template)
1. [The AI Questions Framework](./session-plan.md#the-ai-questions-framework)

### Part 1: Build the page

1. **Basic structure** - Create a page with a heading "About Me", a short introduction paragraph about yourself, and a list of 3 hobbies/interests.

2. **Add styling** - Add styling to the page to centre the heading, add a custom font, and a background color.

3. **Add interactivity** - Add a button on the page that changes the background to a random color when it's clicked.

4. **Make it responsive** - Use media queries to style the page for mobile and desktop size screens.

### Part 2: Reflection

Answer the following questions with short answers (3-5 sentences):

1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task
2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?
3. How would you explain the difference between **using Copilot to generate code for you** vs. **using it as an effective learning partner**?
4. Identify 3 **risks of relying too much on AI tools** when learning at HackYourFuture.

### Submission

Submit your code as usual, and create a text file named `reflection.md` alongside your code to write your answers to the above questions.
