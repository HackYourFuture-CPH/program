# Preparation

During the Pre-Course you've already went through the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To get ready for next Sunday's session, we would like you to put all this knowledge to practice by building a simple order form page. We've already provided you with some of the markup for a start. It's recommended that you download and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write your code, and then upload it to [CodePen](https://codepen.io) for easy review.

## Order Form

Build the order form visible below using the [provided markup](./assignment-order-form/index.html) and [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/VwksDkp1vSPhpfa62LWIAz/HTML%2FCSS-session1?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=seawrJIXVyPoIt9L-0)\*

Make sure that your code is:

- Properly formatted and indented ([How to format code with Prettier in Visual Studio Code](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-format-code-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code))
- The end result looks good both on desktop and mobile
- You've used CSS class selectors instead of IDs or tags ([Why you should avoid using IDs in CSS](https://medium.com/@clairecodes/reasons-not-to-use-ids-in-css-a42204fb0d97))
- There are no unused CSS properties (avoid using the copy code function in Figma)
- The markup is semantic ([MDN Web Docs - Semantics in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html))
