# Final project (Foundation)

Welcome to your final project! Here you can learn more about the goals and requirements of this final module.

## Learning Goals

- [ ] Developing your own additional requirements (i.e. adding your own flair to the project)
- [ ] Practice breaking big problems down into smaller tasks
- [ ] Managing your own tasks within a tight deadline
- [ ] Understanding how and when to ask for help at the right time
- [ ] Taking a project from idea to completion, including deploying it to the web

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

## Organisation Requirements

TODO finalise this list

(We intend that the project should be run in pairs. They should use some kind of basic prj management learned in Team Processes module. Until that module is complete, we can't write the final list here. But stay tuned!)
