# Career Training (Week 2)

In this interactive online session, we explore how **CVs and LinkedIn profiles** complement each other in the eyes of recruiters and hiring managers - particularly within the tech industry.

We will focus on:

- The **distinct role** each platform plays in showcasing your professional identity:
  - The **CV** as your structured, tailored overview for specific roles
  - **LinkedIn** as your living, network-driven professional brand
- What **recruiters typically look for** on each platform, including consistency across them, clarity of skills and achievements, and active engagement.

Participants then split into **breakout groups** to review and give feedback on fictional CVs and LinkedIn profiles, using real-life examples to reflect on how effectively these platforms represent their professional value.

These articles, videos and tasks are not a suggestion, but mandatory. They require less time than your regular assignments, but are just as important. We expect you to use the remainder of your 30 hours on finishing all the assignments you haven't yet completed.

- [ ] Identify how their CV and LinkedIn play together.
