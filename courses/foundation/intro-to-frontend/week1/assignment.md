# Assignment

## So why this assignment?

**Interacting with the DOM is a crucial part** of building a web app. If we cannot interact with the DOM then the javascript we write cannot change what we see in the browser. **Connecting javascript to the browser opens up a new world of possibilities** where only the imagination is the limiting factor. These assignments will help you get a glimpse into what is possible.

## 2. Hogwarts House generator

In the Harry Potter series, every student of Hogwarts school is placed into a house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).

Let's create a page where **a user writes their name** in an input element. The user then clicks a button. The user will now **receive a Hogwarts House**, e.g. "Benjamin belongs in Slytherin!"

### 2.1. Markup time!

Create an input element, a button and a tag to display the Hogwarts house into.

### 2.2. Setting up the events

When the user clicks the button, get the name the user wrote in the input field.

### 2.3. Choosing a house

Now we can get the users name, next step is to **add the Hogwarts house string** and display that with the users name in this format: "`Name` belongs in `House`!".

Store the houses in an array, and return a random one to be assigned to the user.

### 2.4. Trying again

If a user isn't happy with the house they ended up in, they should be able to try again. Make sure if the user wants to, they can click a button to try and get into a different house.

### 2.5. No input

What if the user clicks to get assigned a house, but they didn't supply their name? What's the best way to handle this situation?

### 2.6. New feature?

Think of a new feature or design to add to your generator, and implement it! Maybe a cool animation? Or a description of each house? Or some images to represent the houses? Or a beautifully styled UI?

## 3. hyfBay

You have been hired to build a simple app lightly inspired by eBay called hyfBay.

It should be a website where a user can search for a product. The products can also be filtered and sorted, depending on what the user is looking for.

### 3.1. Let's get started!

In your assignment repo, you will find a template to get started with:

- `main.js` - This is where you will be writing your JavaScript code.
- `hyfBayHelpers.js` - This defines a function called getAvailableProducts that you can use to get an array of products to display on your website.
- `index.html` - A basic html page that you can add some markup and styles to.

### 3.2. Requirements

You should implement the following functionality:

- The product list should be generated by calling a function called `renderProducts(products)`, that you will write.
- You should use the `getAvailableProducts` function to get a list of products to use.
- The list of products should be rendered as a html list.
- The product list items should contain `title`, `price` and `rating`

#### Tips

Feeling stuck? here's some tips on where to start:

1. Your HTML needs a `ul` element that can contain all the products. You can then select that `ul` using `document.querySelector` in JavaScript, and modify its contents.
2. To generate the content, for each `product` in the `products` array:
   1. [create an `li`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
   2. Set the innerHTML of that `li` to the contain the title, price and rating
   3. [Append the `li`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) to the `ul`
