# Technical Application

üëã Welcome!

This module describes the application process for joining HackYourFuture Denmark, specifically the Foundation course. If you have been invited to take part in the Technical Application, please continue reading.

The following pages will take you through the different stages of the application process, so please read and complete each section carefull.y

The whole application process should take around 30 hours, and you have approximately 10 days to complete all parts. We strongly advise that you spread out the workload across the 10 days, and **don't leave it all until the last minute!**

## ü•∏ Requirements

You will have 10 days to do the FreeCodeCamp courses and the technical assignment. 

In this time, you must: 
1. **Finish 2 courses** from the Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp
1. **Alongside the courses** you complete the technical assignment in CodePen while progressing in the course. 
1. **Finish the technical assignment**, applying any touch ups required or extra features. 
1. **Record a project-overview video**.

You can find more detailed instructions in the **üõ†Ô∏è Technical task** section. 

When submitting the assignment, you will have to deliver the following:
* Links to your GitHub and freeCodeCamp accounts
* A screenshot of the completed courses in freeCodeCamp 
* A link to your CodePen for the Event Page assignment
* Upload your project overview video

All of this should take you about **30 hours**. Find your own pace in this process, but we recommend spreading the hours across the 10 days and not leaving it all until the last minute. ‚è≥ ü•µ

If you are not sure, we could recommend dividing your time like this:
* 1 hour to read and understand the instructions
* 2 hours each day for 10 days to work on the technical tasks
* 8 extra hours to work on the technical task on days when you have more time, for example, on the weekend
* 1 hour for preparing and making the project overview video

‚è± You should organize your time however it fits your schedule best - the above is only a recommendation! Good time management is a crucial skill to succeed with this bootcamp. Keep in mind that the amount of hours required for this test assignment is similar to what the bootcamp requires *every week*.

## ‚è≥ Deadline
You should have received a deadline from your contact person at HYF. 
*Late submissions will not be considered*.

## üì´ After submission
After submitting, please be patient and wait to hear from us while we review all the submissions. We will let you know the date to expect an answer from us by.

Make sure to save `cph@hackyourfuture.dk` and `info@hackyourfuture.dk` in your contacts, so our emails don't end up in your spam folder.

* ‚úÖ If you make it to the next stage, you will receive an email from us with an invitation to a short online interview with two members from HackYourFuture. 
* ‚õîÔ∏è If you do not make it to the interview stage, we will also let you know via email.

Being a professional developer is a continuous learning process. While you are waiting for your test to be reviewed, we strongly suggest you continue with the Responsive Web Design certification on FreeCodeCamp to strengthen your skills. 

Your coding journey has already started by this point, and you now will have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, maybe even a bit of JavaScript. We won't spend much time going into HTML and CSS so it would be a good idea to strengthen your skills and knowledge before joining.
