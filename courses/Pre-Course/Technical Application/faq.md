# ‚ùì FAQ



<details>

<summary>Can I submit after the deadline?</summary>

Late submissions will not be accepted. Remember there are multiple application rounds a year, so if this time does not work for you, you can try again.

<summary>What if I cannot finish the assignment on time? </summary>

The scope of the assignment is carefully considered and the days until submission deadline should be enough to complete all the parts. This may seem difficult, but it is a reflection of the fast pace of HackYourFuture, if you get in. If you are not able to meet this deadline, you should ask yourself if you can keep up with 8 months of intense study that only gets progressively harder. Practice a bit more, find the best learning methods that fit you, and continue on your own, and once you feel ready, apply again!&#x20;

<details>

<summary>How much time does the assignment take?</summary>

The assignment and the additional parts should take you not more than 30 hours in total. If you are working, this still gives you 3 hours a day across the 10 days, and you can put more hours in on your days off.&#x20;

<summary>How should I make the video?</summary>

You can use a laptop camera, your phone, or any other way you prefer to make the video. You can make it yourself or have someone else hold the camera. It does not need to be a professional video ;)

<summary>Can I use online resources to help me with the technical task?</summary>

Big yes! A really important part of learning web development is learning to search for the answers yourself on the internet. You are free to look for information using Google searches, ChatGPT, YouTube, etc. We encourage you to Google search words and concepts you do not understand, or to use ChatGPT to better understand concepts. Do not use ChatGPT to simply get an answer. AI generated answers will be flagged and we may ask you about it during an interview.\
\
It is important however to try to understand the concepts you are working with, and avoid copy and pasting. It takes time, but ultimately it will only make you a great developer!
