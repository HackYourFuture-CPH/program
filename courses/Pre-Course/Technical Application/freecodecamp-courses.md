# ðŸ’» FreeCodeCamp courses

It is only a part of what you need to do, so make sure to keep a good pace! \
You need to leave yourself time to make the [event-page-technical-task](event-page-technical-task/ "mention"), make a [project-overview-video.md](project-overview-video.md "mention"), and complete any additional parts before submission.&#x20;



1. Create an account on GitHub (if you don't have one yet): [<mark style="color:blue;">https://github.com/</mark>](https://github.com/)
2. Register on [<mark style="color:blue;">https://www.freecodecamp.org/</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) with your `Github profile`\

3. Go into your [<mark style="color:blue;">settings</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings) on `freeCodeCamp` and make your timeline public:

Remember to save after changing the settings!



4. Complete all the steps in the first 2 courses in the [<mark style="color:blue;">Responsive Web Design certification</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/):

* 1\) Learn HTML by [<mark style="color:blue;">Building a Cat Photo App</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/)
* 2\) Learn Basic CSS by [<mark style="color:blue;">Building a Cafe Menu</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/)\
  \
  This is how the completed courses should look in your profile:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

Don't get frightened by the amount of steps in each course!

\
Most of the steps are very, very small - you are learning HTML and CSS through them very gradually. Each step might take you anywhere from 10 seconds to a couple of minutes, even for a complete web development newbie!&#x20;



5. We recommend while going through the [<mark style="color:blue;">Building a Cafe Menu</mark>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/), following each step of the course you try to apply each step in the creation of your [event-page-technical-task](event-page-technical-task/ "mention"). This will allow you to progress in the most effective way and apply each topic you learn into the required task. \
   \
   Of course this is just a recommendation on how you could approach this, so feel free to work and complete the task in whatever way you feel most appropriate.&#x20;
