# AI Usage During the Application Process

During the application process, you may wish to use AI in some form to help you. These guidelines will explain how HackYourFuture approaches AI usage, and what is expected from you.

> [!WARNING]
> It’s important you follow these guidelines. If we find evidence of you misusing AI based on the below, you may be rejected from the application process.

## Using AI (such as ChatGPT) during the application process

### You are welcome to use AI, if you wish, in cases similar to the following

1. Looking up technical words or concepts to learn more about them
1. Learning about different programming solutions that you haven’t come across yet (e.g. new JavaScript functions that you didn’t cover in freeCodeCamp).

### You are not allowed to use AI in the following cases

1. To generate specific coding solutions or snippets (e.g. asking AI how to program something, and then copying and pasting the code into your codebase).
1. To generate code comments or explanations of the solutions you create (they should be written by you, based on your own understanding).
1. To generate your written communication to us (e.g. application form, emails, cover letters)
1. During the live interviews/calls to help you answer questions (unless the interviewer asks you to use AI)

## How your experience and knowledge will be evaluated

While you may choose to use AI to help you during the application process, please be aware that **you will be required to be able to explain all of your answers and code** using your own understanding and words.

For example, if you use AI to help you learn about a specific CSS feature that you end up using, we may ask you in the interview to explain what each line of your CSS code does in detail.

## HackYourFuture’s stance on AI

While the world is exploding with the introduction of AI, and changing rapidly every day, it’s unclear still on the long term impact and changes AI will have in our day to day work and lives.

For now, we know AI is a useful tool in many areas - we also use it internally at HYF! Therefore, to maintain realism and fairness, we aim to support a reasonable and effective usage of AI. During your time at HYF, you will also have the opportunity to learn more about the practical, effective and ethical use of AI in the workplace.

It is, however, important in the application process for us to understand your personal level of experience, knowledge and skills - because you’re the one who we’ll be training if you join HYF! That’s why we require you to be able to communicate and explain all of your answers and code in detail (e.g. in the interview), without the help of AI.
