# The structure of this presentation

## Introduction

Key points:

- this module is rather different from the other technical modules
- you don't have to remember everything in this module
- the purpose of this module is to give an understanding of how the remaining modules fit together

## HTTP

Key points:

- the structure of a URL (scheme, host, path)
- finding a host with DNS
- establishing a connection (TCP)
- Content-Type instead of file extension
- an HTTP GET request/response, at the most simple level

## Front end vs back end

Key points:

- To make our web page available, we have to have a server
- That server needs to run some software: a web (http) server
- The server needs whatever software _it_ runs, plus files for the browser
- Some of our code runs in the browser; some of our code runs on the host
- This is "front end" and "back end"

## The front end

Key points:

- Usually the starting URL is going to be `text/html`
- How HTML refers to other resources
- JavaScript is the only available language
- What JavaScript in the browser can and can't do
- Typical things we'll do with front-end JavaScript

## The back end

Key points:

- http listen, handle request
- what HTTP requests/responses "look like"
- serving static content
- it is just software. We can extend it!
- any language, but we'll be using JavaScript

## Data and APIs

Key points:

- TODO
- data store services (in the abstract). Peristing data away from the web server.

## More complex setups

Key points:

- This section talks about things _beyond_ what Hack Your Future covers
- It's a taster of what things start to look like in larger, real-world scenarios
- The client/server terminology
- Adding a database server
- Multiple environments
