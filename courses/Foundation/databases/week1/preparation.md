## Pre-Class Preparation

We will use **SQLite** for all exercises, as it requires no installation and works out-of-the-box with most environments.

## Tools setup

We're going to use Dbeaver, a free and open-source database management tool that supports SQLite and many other databases.

- [ ] Download and install [Dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/)

There's also a VSCode extension for SQLite called [SQlite Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qwtel.sqlite-viewer).
