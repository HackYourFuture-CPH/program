# Assignment

TODO
The legacy assignments are related to meal sharing and sql injection, which are out of scope here. We need to come up with new ones.

Current suggestions (not decided):
1. Add some further basic endpoints to the simple web server they started in the session
2. Practice using Postman to create working requests for some public api (each request increasing in complexity)
