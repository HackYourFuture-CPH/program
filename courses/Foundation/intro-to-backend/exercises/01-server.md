# Server

Navigate to `intro-to-backend` in your assignment repo and open it in your code editor, where you'll find some exercises ready to complete.

## Exercise 1
Let's start by taking a look at `exercise1.js`. Here you'll find a simple webserver with a route already set up on "/". 

Run your webserver to see it in action:

```shell
nodemon exercise1.js
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to verify that everything is working as expected. You should see a page that displays the string being returned in the "/" route function.

Change this string to anything you like, and refresh your browser to see it change.

Next, you need to implement a new route called "/currentYear". You can find this function in `exercise1.js` already, you just need to implement it!

**Commit your work**:
When everything is working, don't forget to save your work. Use `git add` and `git commit` to save your working code before continuing with the next exercise.
