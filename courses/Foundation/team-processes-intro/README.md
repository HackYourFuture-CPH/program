# Team Processes Intro

TODO 

This module is currently under development for use in the current live teams. Once we have it, it should be placed here. For now, we keep a 1 week placeholder.

It will introduce principles and processes around working in a dev team, scrum, backlog, tasks, rituals (e.g. standup), value of transparency and collaboration.
