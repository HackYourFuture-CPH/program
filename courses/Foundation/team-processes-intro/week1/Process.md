# 🧩 Part 1: Introduction to Agile and Waterfall (30 minutes)

## 🔹 Learning Objectives

• Understand the historical context and motivation for Agile  
• Identify the limitations of traditional Waterfall development  
• Grasp the high-level Agile values and principles

## 📖 Content

### 🔸 What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a **sequential software development model**: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance

✅ Pros:  
• Predictable  
• Good for fixed requirements

❌ Cons:  
• Late feedback  
• High cost of change  
• Misalignment risk

### 🔸 Why Agile Emerged

Agile was created in response to Waterfall's rigidity. The **Agile Manifesto (2001)** values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation  
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### 🔸 Agile vs. Waterfall

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Aspect|Waterfall|Agile|
|Structure|Sequential|Iterative|
|Change Handling|Rigid|Flexible|
|Customer Involvement|Limited|Continuous|
|Testing|At the end|Ongoing|
|Delivery|Big-bang|Incremental|

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Agile is not a methodology — it's a **mindset** focused on value, learning, and adaptability.

# 🧩 Part 2: Basics of Scrum (50 minutes)

## 🔹 Learning Objectives

• Understand Scrum’s place within Agile  
• Learn roles, events, and artifacts of Scrum  
• Grasp core principles of empiricism and iterative delivery

## 📖 Content

### 🔸 What is Scrum?

Scrum is a lightweight framework used by 87% of Agile teams (2024). It is based on empirical process control and supports frequent delivery, learning, and feedback.

### 🔸 Scrum Principles

• Empiricism — Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation  
• Self-management — Teams decide how to work  
• Cross-functionality — Team has all skills needed  
• Iterative Progress — Frequent increments to inspect and adapt

### 🔸 Scrum Roles

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Role|Responsibilities|
|Product Owner|Maximizes value, owns the Product Backlog|
|Scrum Master|Coaches, facilitates, removes impediments|
|Developers|Cross-functional professionals building the product|

### 🔸 Scrum Events

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Event|Purpose|
|Sprint|Time-boxed iteration (max 1 month)|
|Sprint Planning|Define Sprint Goal, select work, plan delivery|
|Daily Scrum|15-min sync for progress and re-planning|
|Sprint Review|Present Increment, gather feedback|
|Sprint Retrospective|Reflect and improve team collaboration and processes|

### 🔸 Scrum Artifacts

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Artifact|Description|
|Product Backlog|Ordered list of everything needed in the product|
|Sprint Backlog|Selected work for Sprint + delivery plan|
|Increment|Working product output that meets the Definition of Done|

📌 **Definition of Done (DoD):** Shared understanding of “complete”, enforced by Developers, ensures transparency and consistency.

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Scrum gives structure to Agile — it’s simple, but powerful when practiced with discipline and empathy.

# 🧩 Part 3: Conflict Management & Collaboration (20 minutes)

## 🔹 Learning Objectives

• Understand team dynamics and why conflict occurs  
• Learn how to manage disagreements constructively  
• See conflict as a sign of team growth

## 📖 Content

### 🔸 Why Conflict Happens

• Role silos, misunderstandings, or competing priorities  
• Agile teams are cross-functional — conflict is inevitable  
• Left unresolved, it leads to waste and disengagement

### 🔸 Agile’s Approach to Conflict

• Address early via Daily Scrums or Retrospectives  
• Use shared goals (Sprint Goal, DoD) to align  
• Handle issues with data, not emotion

### 🔸 Tuckman’s Team Development Model

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Stage|Description|
|Forming|Polite but unclear roles|
|Storming|Conflict arises, testing boundaries|
|Norming|Agreed norms form, better collaboration|
|Performing|High-functioning, autonomous team|
|Adjourning|Team disbands after work is done|

### 🔸 Principles for Managing Conflict

• Perspective-taking — Seek to understand before reacting  
• Common ground — Focus on shared values  
• Respectful dialogue — Use retrospectives and one-on-ones  
• Shared artifacts — Use DoD or Sprint Goals as anchors

### 🔸 Agile Tools to Resolve Conflict

• Sprint Retrospective — Safe space for process improvement  
• Working Agreements — Documented team norms  
• Check-ins — Emotional temperature checks  
• Facilitated discussion — Scrum Master supports dialogue

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Conflict is not failure — it’s a growth opportunity. Agile teams that embrace open dialogue and reflection become stronger, faster, and more resilient.
