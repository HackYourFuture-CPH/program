# Lesson Plan

## Main topics

- Basic principles of Agile
- Agile vs Waterfall
- Basics of Scrum (agile framework, core principles, roles, artifacts, ceremonies)
- Basic implementation of the concepts (tasks, backlog, simple board, basic project workflow)
- How to prioritise using basic MoSCoW method
- How a basic project set up looks

Note: This module is in Foundation, which means trainees are not becoming specialised developers yet. The above topics should be kept high level, focussing on the principles rather than deeper details. For example, it's good to explain that a principle of scrum that decisions are made on data, but no need to go into depths of calculating velocity and burndown charts at this point. These full details should be covered more in the specialism courses.

## Content

## 🧩 Part 1: Introduction to Agile and Waterfall (30 minutes)

## 🔹 Introduction Learning Objectives

• Understand the historical context and motivation for Agile
• Identify the limitations of traditional Waterfall development
• Grasp the high-level Agile values and principles

## 📖 Content

### 🔸 What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a **sequential software development model**: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance

✅ Pros:
• Predictable
• Good for fixed requirements

❌ Cons:
• Late feedback
• High cost of change
• Misalignment risk

### 🔸 Why Agile Emerged

Agile was created in response to Waterfall's rigidity. The **Agile Manifesto (2001)** values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### 🔸 Agile vs. Waterfall

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Aspect|Waterfall|Agile|
|Structure|Sequential|Iterative|
|Change Handling|Rigid|Flexible|
|Customer Involvement|Limited|Continuous|
|Testing|At the end|Ongoing|
|Delivery|Big-bang|Incremental|

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Agile is not a methodology — it's a **mindset** focused on value, learning, and adaptability.

## 🧩 Part 2: Basics of Scrum (50 minutes)

## 🔹 Scrum Learning Objectives

• Understand Scrum’s place within Agile
• Learn roles, events, and artifacts of Scrum
• Grasp core principles of empiricism and iterative delivery

## 📖 Scrum Content

### 🔸 What is Scrum?

Scrum is a lightweight framework used by 87% of Agile teams (2024). It is based on empirical process control and supports frequent delivery, learning, and feedback.

### 🔸 Scrum Principles

• Empiricism — Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
• Self-management — Teams decide how to work
• Cross-functionality — Team has all skills needed
• Iterative Progress — Frequent increments to inspect and adapt

### 🔸 Scrum Roles

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Role|Responsibilities|
|Product Owner|Maximizes value, owns the Product Backlog|
|Scrum Master|Coaches, facilitates, removes impediments|
|Developers|Cross-functional professionals building the product|

### 🔸 Scrum Events

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Event|Purpose|
|Sprint|Time-boxed iteration (max 1 month)|
|Sprint Planning|Define Sprint Goal, select work, plan delivery|
|Daily Scrum|15-min sync for progress and re-planning|
|Sprint Review|Present Increment, gather feedback|
|Sprint Retrospective|Reflect and improve team collaboration and processes|

### 🔸 Scrum Artifacts

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Artifact|Description|
|Product Backlog|Ordered list of everything needed in the product|
|Sprint Backlog|Selected work for Sprint + delivery plan|
|Increment|Working product output that meets the Definition of Done|

📌 **Definition of Done (DoD):** Shared understanding of “complete”, enforced by Developers, ensures transparency and consistency.

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Scrum gives structure to Agile — it’s simple, but powerful when practiced with discipline and empathy.

## 🧩 Part 3: Conflict Management & Collaboration (20 minutes)

## 🔹 Conflict Management Learning Objectives

• Understand team dynamics and why conflict occurs
• Learn how to manage disagreements constructively
• See conflict as a sign of team growth

## 📖 Conflict Management Content

### 🔸 Why Conflict Happens

• Role silos, misunderstandings, or competing priorities
• Agile teams are cross-functional — conflict is inevitable
• Left unresolved, it leads to waste and disengagement

### 🔸 Agile’s Approach to Conflict

• Address early via Daily Scrums or Retrospectives
• Use shared goals (Sprint Goal, DoD) to align
• Handle issues with data, not emotion

### 🔸 Tuckman’s Team Development Model

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Stage|Description|
|Forming|Polite but unclear roles|
|Storming|Conflict arises, testing boundaries|
|Norming|Agreed norms form, better collaboration|
|Performing|High-functioning, autonomous team|
|Adjourning|Team disbands after work is done|

### 🔸 Principles for Managing Conflict

• Perspective-taking — Seek to understand before reacting
• Common ground — Focus on shared values
• Respectful dialogue — Use retrospectives and one-on-ones
• Shared artifacts — Use DoD or Sprint Goals as anchors

### 🔸 Agile Tools to Resolve Conflict

• Sprint Retrospective — Safe space for process improvement
• Working Agreements — Documented team norms
• Check-ins — Emotional temperature checks
• Facilitated discussion — Scrum Master supports dialogue

🧠 **Key Takeaway:** Conflict is not failure — it’s a growth opportunity. Agile teams that embrace open dialogue and reflection become stronger, faster, and more resilient.

## Exercises


## 🎯 Exercise 1: Agile vs. Waterfall Scenarios (10 minutes)

Present 3 short case studies (e.g., Hospital system, Game app, Mars Rover).

• Ask groups: Should this project use Agile or Waterfall? Why?
• Facilitate group discussion and reflection.

## 👥 Exercise 2: Role Matching (5 minutes)

Provide a set of role descriptions and ask learners to match them with the correct Scrum roles.

• Example: “This person ensures the team understands the goal of each Sprint” → Product Owner

## 🧠 Exercise 3: Conflict Reflection (5 minutes)

Ask each participant to reflect and write down:

• One example of conflict from a group project
• How it was resolved (or not)
• What could have been done differently using Agile principles

## 🗓️ Exercise 4: Ceremonies Timeline (10 minutes)

Give teams a blank Sprint calendar template. Task:

• Place Scrum ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, etc.) in the correct order and timing

## 🧪 Optional Group Activity: Mini Retrospective Simulation (if time allows)

Split into small teams and simulate a 5-minute Sprint Retrospective after a quick creative task.

• Example: Teams build a paper tower, then retrospect on collaboration and process
