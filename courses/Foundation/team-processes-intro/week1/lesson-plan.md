# Lesson Plan

## Main Topics

- Basic principles of Agile
- Agile vs. Waterfall
- Basics of Scrum (agile framework, core principles, roles, artifacts,
  ceremonies)
- Basic implementation of the concepts (tasks, backlog, simple board,
  basic project workflow)
- How to prioritize using the basic MoSCoW method
- How a basic project setup looks

**Note:** This module is in Foundation, which means trainees are not becoming
specialized developers yet. The above topics should be kept high-level, focusing
on the principles rather than deeper details. For example, it's good to explain
that a principle of Scrum is that decisions are made based on data, but there is
no need to go into the depths of calculating velocity and burndown charts at
this point. These full details should be covered more in the specialization
courses.

## Content

### Part 1: Introduction to Agile and Waterfall (30 minutes)

### üîπ Introduction Learning Objectives

- Understand the historical context and motivation for Agile
- Identify the limitations of traditional Waterfall development
- Grasp the high-level Agile values and principles

### üìñ Content

#### üî∏ What is Waterfall?

Waterfall is a **sequential software development model**: Requirements, Design,
Implementation, Verification, Maintenance.

**Pros:**

- Predictable
- Good for fixed requirements

**Cons:**

- Late feedback
- High cost of change
- Misalignment risk

#### üî∏ Why Agile Emerged

Agile was created in response to Waterfall's rigidity. The **Agile Manifesto
(2001)** values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

#### üî∏ Agile vs. Waterfall

| Aspect               | Waterfall  | Agile       |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Structure            | Sequential | Iterative   |
| Change Handling      | Rigid      | Flexible    |
| Customer Involvement | Limited    | Continuous  |
| Testing              | At the end | Ongoing     |
| Delivery             | Big-bang   | Incremental |

**Key Takeaway:** Agile is not a methodology ‚Äî it's a **mindset** focused on
value, learning, and adaptability.

### Exercise 1: Agile vs. Waterfall Scenarios (10 minutes)

Present 3 short case studies (e.g., Hospital system, Game app, Mars Rover).

- Ask groups: Should this project use Agile or Waterfall? Why?
- Facilitate group discussion and reflection.

### Part 2: Basics of Scrum (50 minutes)

### Scrum Learning Objectives

- Understand Scrum‚Äôs place within Agile
- Learn roles, events, and artifacts of Scrum
- Grasp core principles of empiricism and iterative delivery

### Scrum Content

#### üî∏ What is Scrum?

Scrum is a lightweight framework used by 87% of Agile teams (2024). It is based
on empirical process control and supports frequent delivery, learning, and
feedback.

#### üî∏ Scrum Principles

- **Empiricism** ‚Äî Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
- **Self-management** ‚Äî Teams decide how to work
- **Cross-functionality** ‚Äî Team has all skills needed
- **Iterative Progress** ‚Äî Frequent increments to inspect and adapt

#### üî∏ Scrum Roles

| Role          | Responsibilities                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Owner | Maximizes value, owns the Product Backlog           |
| Scrum Master  | Coaches, facilitates, removes impediments           |
| Developers    | Cross-functional professionals building the product |

#### üî∏ Scrum Events

| Event                | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sprint               | Time-boxed iteration (max 1 month)                   |
| Sprint Planning      | Define Sprint Goal, select work, plan delivery       |
| Daily Scrum          | 15-min sync for progress and re-planning             |
| Sprint Review        | Present Increment, gather feedback                   |
| Sprint Retrospective | Reflect and improve team collaboration and processes |

#### üî∏ Scrum Artifacts

| Artifact        | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything needed in the product         |
| Sprint Backlog  | Selected work for Sprint + delivery plan                 |
| Increment       | Working product output that meets the Definition of Done |

**Definition of Done (DoD):** Shared understanding of ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù enforced by
Developers, ensures transparency and consistency.

**Key Takeaway:** Scrum gives structure to Agile ‚Äî it‚Äôs simple, but powerful
when practiced with discipline and empathy.

### Scrum Master vs. Project Manager

#### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is a facilitator and coach for the Agile team. Their primary
role is to support the team in following Scrum principles, ensure that Scrum
events (like Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, and Retrospectives) run smoothly,
and help remove any impediments that block progress. They don‚Äôt manage the team
or assign tasks. Instead, they enable the team to self-organize, collaborate,
and continuously improve. The Scrum Master also works closely with the Product
Owner to maintain focus on delivering value.

#### Project Manager

A Project Manager is traditionally responsible for the overall planning,
execution, and delivery of a project. This includes defining scope, creating
schedules, managing budgets, assigning tasks, and ensuring that the project is
completed on time and within budget. They typically operate in more structured
or Waterfall environments, where they lead and direct the team‚Äôs work based on
pre-defined plans.

#### Main Difference

The key distinction lies in their approach and authority. The Scrum Master
supports a self-managing Agile team without directing them, while the Project
Manager takes ownership of the entire project lifecycle and actively directs
team tasks. Scrum Masters focus on process and team empowerment. Project
Managers focus on control, coordination, and delivery.

### Exercise 2: Role Matching (5 minutes)

Provide a set of role descriptions and ask learners to match them with the
correct Scrum roles.

- Example: ‚ÄúThis person ensures the team understands the goal of each Sprint‚Äù
  ‚Üí Product Owner
