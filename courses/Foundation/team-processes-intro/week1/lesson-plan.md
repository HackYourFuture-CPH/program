# Lesson Plan

## Main topics

- Basic principles of Agile
- Agile vs Waterfall
- Basics of Scrum (agile framework, core principles, roles, artifacts, ceremonies)
- Basic implementation of the concepts (tasks, backlog, simple board, basic project workflow)
- How to prioritise using basic MoSCoW method
- How a basic project set up looks

Note: This module is in Foundation, which means trainees are not becoming specialised developers yet. The above topics should be kept high level, focussing on the principles rather than deeper details. For example, it's good to explain that a principle of scrum that decisions are made on data, but no need to go into depths of calculating velocity and burndown charts at this point. These full details should be covered more in the specialism courses.
