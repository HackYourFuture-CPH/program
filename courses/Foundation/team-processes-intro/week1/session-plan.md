# Session Plan

## Session Outline

1. What is project management
2. Basic principles and values of Agile
3. Basics of Scrum
4. Simple project setup
5. Simple prioritisation using MoSCoW

**Note:** This module is in Foundation, which means trainees are not becoming
specialized developers yet. The above topics should be kept high-level, focusing
on the principles rather than deeper details. For example, it's good to explain
that a principle of Scrum is that decisions are made based on data, but there is
no need to go into the depths of calculating velocity and burndown charts at
this point. These full details should be covered more in the specialization
courses.

### What is project management

We organise projects to help provide some structure for a group of people to achieve some shared goal by working together.

Project management describes different best practices and approaches we can take to organising some work to avoid wasting time, effort, resources, money, and most importantly end up building the thing we started out to achieve. 

Imagine you're about to go on a hike with a group of friends. Project management means you have a map and a plan before you set off, and to help you as you go on. You need to know:
- What path you'll take around the mountain
- What your end destination is
- How you'll get there
- What you need to pack
- Who will carry what along the way

Without project management, even a clever bunch of people can go in the wrong direction, duplicate work, miss deadlines, or build entirely the wrong thing.

Good project management keeps everyone aligned, on the same page, tackles problems early, and gives everyone the best chance of achieving the shared goal together.
