# Session Plan

## Session Outline

1. What is project management
2. Basic principles and values of Agile
3. Basics of Scrum
4. Simple project setup
5. Simple prioritisation using MoSCoW

**Note:** This module is in Foundation, which means trainees are not becoming
specialized developers yet. The above topics should be kept high-level, focusing
on the principles rather than deeper details. For example, it's good to explain
that a principle of Scrum is that decisions are made based on data, but there is
no need to go into the depths of calculating velocity and burndown charts at
this point. These full details should be covered more in the specialization
courses.
