# Lesson Plan

## Session Format
In-person, full-day Sunday session focused on realistic technical interviews, peer feedback, and technical volunteer involvement. Students present and explain a React-based technical challenge they’ve built over the prior 2.5 days.

## Session Goal
Create a realistic but supportive interview environment where students can:
Practice explaining technical decisions clearly and confidently
Gain actionable feedback on both technical and soft skills
Improve their readiness for real developer interviews

## Key Message to Reinforce
“It’s not about having the perfect code - it’s about clearly explaining your process, decisions, and problem-solving approach.”

TODO add further notes about screening interview prep, including slack message to send
