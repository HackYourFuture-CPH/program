# Career Training

We need to cover career skills in foundation for two reasons: these skills take a long time to practice and develop, so they should start now. Secondly, in theory some people could leave now with the goal to get an entry level role in tech, and we should prepare them as best we can.

We already have an existing module that we will teach the same at the end of a specialism, but let’s use it for inspiration here too:

**Week 1:** Some light version of [legacy week1](../../../legacy/career-training/week-1/) and [legacy week 2](../../../legacy/career-training/week-2/) combined and tweak to be more relevant for foundation grads. Technical interviews (../../../legacy/career-training/week-3/) are mostly only relevant for software engineers, so leave that out of here (let’s use them in the application process to a specialism course instead, for practice).
