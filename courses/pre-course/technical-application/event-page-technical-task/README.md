4. **Learning Resources:**

> [!INFO]
> Be curious and google it! Search for articles, blog posts, documentation, youtube tutorials and alike to learn more and understand how to implement any of the steps.

> [!INFO]
> While doing this task, [inspect](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect) the website to see what is happening with the elements and the styling. Refer to the [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) to understand which styling properties to change to make things look right.

5. **Inspect and Debug:**\
   While doing this task, inspect the website elements to understand the styling. Refer to the CSS Box Model to identify and adjust the necessary styling properties.

## General Steps

- [ ] **Responsive Units**: Ensure there are no large (>50) pixel values in your stylesheet. Apply responsive units instead. Study and try to apply responsive units. See the article about [responsive web design](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/responsive-web-design-choosing-the-right-unit-4cf2e7d72db7) and investigate _CSS units_.
- [ ] **Layout with Flexbox**:
  - Use CSS Flexbox to layout the entire page.
  - Apply Flexbox properties to ensure elements are properly aligned and spaced.
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate (e.g. \<header>, \<nav>, \<main>, \<section>, \<footer>)

### Navigation bar

Build a navigation bar and make it look like in the [event-page-design.md](event-page-design.md "mention").

- [ ] Build a navigation bar that includes links to the various sections of the page.
- [ ] Place the navigation bar at the top of the page.
- [ ] Use the colors from the design.
- [ ] Use the \<nav> semantic HTML tag for the navigation bar.
- [ ] Use [CSS flexbox layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to position the elements in the navigation bar.
- [ ] Make sure to add the logo to navigation bar.

### About Details

- [ ] Add an about section detailing the event (date, time, location, etc.).
- [ ] Use semantic HTML tags and Flexbox for layout.

### Events Section

- [ ] Create a list of events with an image, icons and banner.
- [ ] Include a brief description of the event.
- [ ] Use CSS Flexbox for layout purposes.

### Footer

Build the footer to make it look like in the [event-page-design.md](event-page-design.md "mention").

- [ ] Build the footer with sections (contact information, social media links, etc.).
- [ ] Use Flexbox to style the layout.
- [ ] Apply CSS pseudo-classes to change the color of footer list items on hover.
- [ ] Embed Google Maps using an \<iframe>.

## Mobile layout

Apply _Media Query_ in your CSS file to achieve the mobile layout as seen in the [event-page-design.md](event-page-design.md "mention").

- [ ] Notice how, if you apply flexbox and responsive units, your design will already be responsive for most elements! Investigate the [mobile view](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-inspect) in your browser and see what needs to be styled in order to match the mobile layout design.
- [ ] For the footer, find a way to _remove flex in css for mobile size screen._

## A sprinkle of Javascript

You are now familiar with HTML and CSS and have been through quite a journey of learning. Good job! \
Let's take a peak at the next building block of any proper website - [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript).

- [ ] Remake the logo element in the navigation bar into a button, choose a logo which you like or represents something about you and style it so it looks good and fits in with the design.
- [ ] Find a way to make the button functional so it _alerts some text_ on click. The text could be a fun fact about you!

### :tada: You did it

Go through all the steps once again and refer to the design images to make sure you did your best with this task. \
Take some rest and, when you are ready, go on to make the [project-overview-video.md](../project-overview-video.md "mention").
