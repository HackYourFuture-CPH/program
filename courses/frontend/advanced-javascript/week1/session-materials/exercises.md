# Exercises

Use [generateListings()](./code-inspiration.md#generatelistings) to generate random listings

## forEach

- Create 37 listings and log out every listing's size

## map

- Create an array that contains all the 37 listing prices.

## filter

Using the 37 listings from the previous tasks,

- Create an array of cheap listings. You define what "cheap" means. Each item in this array should be of type `object`
- Create an array of expensive listings' prices. Each item in this array should be of type `number`
- Create an array of listings that have parking. Each item in this array should be of type `object`

## Arrow functions

Rewrite the code above (`forEach`, `map` and `filter`) to arrow functions.

## Listing project

Imagine we have a website like [Danske Bank](https://danskebank.dk/bolig/sogning/liste?sorter=hoejt-forbrug) where a user can search for different parameters. For example: what type the listing should be, the price, size, location etc etc.

### Filter the listings

Image that a user clicks on a button indicating that they only want listings that are of the type "farm". Let's try and imagine how we would use a function to create this functionality:

```js
const listings = generateListings(20);

const filter = {
  type: "farm",
};

const farmListings = filterListings(listings, filter);
```

Okay, so the `filterListings` function takes a filter which is an `object`. Say the user wants "farm" listings that cost more than 1.5 million.

```js
const filter2 = {
  type: "farm",
  minPrice: 1500000,
};

const expensiveFarmListings = filterListings(listings, filter2);
```

Your job is to create the `filterListings` function. The function should support these filters: type, facilities, minPrice, hasGarden and size. Use arrow functions!

### Render the listings

Now create a function called `renderListings`. It should have one parameter: `listings`. When called, the function should render the listings in an html list. How it should be rendered is up to you, but you could take inspiration from [Danske Bank](https://danskebank.dk/bolig/sogning?sorter=hoejt-forbrug)
