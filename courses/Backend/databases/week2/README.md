# Introduction to Databases, Week 2

## Learning Goals

Students should be able to build CRUD functionality using SQL statements, including INSERT INTO, UPDATE and DELETE. The students should also be able to create an entity relationship diagram based on a qualitative description of data requirements, and translate that into a database schema.

## Main Topics

- **CRUD operations:**
  - **Create:** INSERT INTO
  - **Read:** SELECT
  - **Update:** UPDATE
  - **Delete:** DELETE
- **Introduction to relationships:**
  - Simple foreign keys and joining tables (theory and simple examples)
  - Many-to-many relationships (theory and simple examples)
