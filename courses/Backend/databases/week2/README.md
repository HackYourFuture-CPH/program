# Database Security and Transactions

This session is about understanding many-to-many relationships, aggregate functions, and database security. It also covers transactions to ensure data integrity.

## Session Learning Goals

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- [ ] Explain and model many-to-many relationships
- [ ] Use aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)
- [ ] Know that there exists other types of databases (theoretical)
- [ ] Understand database security, specifically SQL Injection
- [ ] Understand and apply database transactions to ensure data integrity

## Main Topics

### Many-to-Many Relationships:
- Explanation of many-to-many relationships
- Handling many-to-many relationships with junction tables

### Aggregate Functions:
  - COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX
  - GROUP BY clause

### Other database models
- Brief theoretical overview
- Key characteristics and use cases for each
- Examples:
  - Key-Value Stores (Redis)
  - Document Stores (MongoDB)
  - Graph Databases (Neo4j)

### Database Security: Roles and SQL Injection (Theoretical)
- Importance of database security
- Common threats to databases
- Roles and permissions in databases (e.g., read, write, admin)
- What SQL Injection is and its risks

### Transactions and Data Integrity (Theoretical)
- What a transaction is
- High-level overview of ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- SQL commands: BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
- Importance in multi-step operations
