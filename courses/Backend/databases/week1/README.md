# Data Modeling and Relational Fundamentals

This session is about understanding the entity relationship model, being able to use that knowledge and implement it building a database schema. With the database schema created, you should be able to create a database and test it using SQL statements.

- [Preparation](./preparation.md)
- [Session Plan](./session-plan.md) (for mentors)
- [Assignment](./assignment.md)

## Learning Goals

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- [ ] Create an entity relationship diagram from a description of data requirements
- [ ] Translate a simple entity relationship diagram into a database schema
- [ ] Use SQL statements for data manipulation (INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables
- [ ] Write SQL queries to retrieve related data using JOIN operations

## Main Topics

- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):
  - Introduction to ERDs
  - Components: Entities, Attributes, Relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:M)
- Translating ERDs to Database Schema:
  - Mapping rules for tables, columns, primary keys (PKs), and foreign keys (FKs)
- Working with Related Data:
  - Foreign Key Constraints (ON DELETE, ON UPDATE actions)
  - SQL JOIN Operations (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
