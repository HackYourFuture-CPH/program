## Code inspiration

### app get vs app use

TODO - What to do with live coding exercises? #122

Go to the `teacher-live-coding` [repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/teacher-live-coding), run `npm install` and run using `nodemon ./src/backend/app-use-vs-app-get.js`. Try and implement this functionality from the bottom while explaining.

### Query parameters vs parameters

Run `nodemon ./src/backend/query-parameters-vs-parameters.js`. Try and implement this functionality from the bottom while explaining.

### Route order

Run `nodemon ./src/backend/route-order.js`. Try and implement this functionality from the bottom while explaining.

### Middleware

Run using `nodemon ./src/backend/middleware.js`. Try and implement this functionality from the bottom while explaining.
